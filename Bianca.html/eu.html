<p> 
    I'm Bianca, a 25-year-old who's absolutely smitten with the world of software engineering. Ever since I was a kid, 
    I've been drawn to logic and all things puzzling. My shelves are stacked with an assortment of magic cubes, 
    and I can spend hours trying to solve them.

    This love for logic and problem-solving led me down the path of studying software engineering. 
    There's something about the way you can break down complex problems and build solutions that just clicks with me. 
    I'm on a mission to delve into the enchanting world of code, where logic and creativity come together

<p>Cats have always held a special place in my heart. Their graceful charm, independent spirit, and soft purring are simply irresistible. I find comfort in their presence and the way they make a house feel like a home. Whether it's their playful antics or their soothing presence, 
    my love for cats is a constant source of joy in my life. They are, without a doubt, my furry companions of choice.
Those are my cats: Jude, Lua and Mila

<p>I have a deep passion for Rubik's Cubes, and I'm proud to say that I have a collection of over 60 of them! Solving these intricate puzzles is not only a hobby but also a source of endless fascination for me. Whether it's speed-solving, learning new solving methods, or simply admiring the intricate designs and patterns that can be created on these cubes, I find immense joy in every aspect of my Rubik's Cube collection.</p>
